Brief Overview of Recreating Akeshya

For my Next.js project, I undertook a task assigned by a prospective employer to showcase my skills. The objective was to recreate the Akeshya website, demonstrating proficiency in modern web development technologies.

Project Details:

Website Recreation: The project involved replicating and improving upon the existing Akeshya website. This included designing responsive layouts, implementing dynamic components, and enhancing user interactions.

Upon completion, I successfully deployed the project using Vercel, making it accessible through the following link: https://akeshya-three.vercel.app/. The deployment on Vercel ensured high performance and reliability, showcasing the project to potential employers as a demonstration of my skills in web development with Next.js and related technologies.

This project not only allowed me to showcase my technical capabilities but also provided valuable experience in recreating a real-world website, employing industry-standard tools and best practices in modern web development.
